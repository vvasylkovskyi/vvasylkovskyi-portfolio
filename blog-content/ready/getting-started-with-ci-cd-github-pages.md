# Collaborative Power of GitHub Pages

**Dive into the collaborative capabilities of GitHub Pages, a seamless platform for hosting and sharing software projects. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up GitHub Pages, automating deployments with GitHub Actions, and witnessing the fruits of your efforts.**

In today's digital landscape, smooth collaboration plays a crucial role in any project's success. GitHub Pages emerges as a brilliant tool in this context, facilitating a straightforward way to host and showcase projects. What makes it stand out is its dual benefit: it's both a hosting platform and a collaborative tool. With GitHub Pages, static websites, documentation, or portfolios can be made accessible without a fuss. This ensures team members, stakeholders, and other viewers can track real-time updates without diving into complex setups. Let's see how you can harness this platform to uplift your collaborative efforts.

## 1. Setting up GitHub Pages

Your GitHub page comes with a unique HTTPS URL, a combination of your GitHub profile or organization and the repository name. This URL predominantly serves the project's static `index.html`. To get the ball rolling:

1. Head to `Settings` -> `Pages` on GitHub.
2. In the `Build and deployment` section, select `Source` -> `Deploy from a branch` -> `gh-pages` -> `root`.
3. Confirm with "Save".

Once set, GitHub automatically refreshes your project whenever the `gh-pages` branch sees changes. You can view your project using the URL highlighted in the `GitHub Pages` section atop the settings page.

## 2. Automation with GitHub Actions

If you peek now, the `gh-pages` branch might appear barren. Let's address that by configuring a `GitHub Action` to auto-populate it.

GitHub Actions, integrated within GitHub, serve as a continuous integration mechanism. The goal is simple: draft an action script that pushes our app onto the `gh-pages` branch post its build. Here's a structured approach:

Begin by creating `.github/workflows` at the project's root, followed by a `main.yml` file. Here’s a practical layout:

```yml
name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "14"

      - name: Install and build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.1
        with:
          folder: dist
          branch: gh-pages
```

**In Brief**:

1. The action activates with every `main` branch push.
2. Utilizing the `ubuntu` environment, it has the authority to push to `gh-pages`.
3. The sequence covers code retrieval, Node.js environment preparation, dependency installation, app construction, and final deployment.

## 3. Witnessing Results

Upon committing to the main branch, observe the GitHub Action's progression under `GitHub` -> `Actions`. If the `dist` folder’s contents mirror `gh-pages`, your deployment hit the mark.

To bask in your project's live glory, head to `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository/`.

## Wrapping Up
