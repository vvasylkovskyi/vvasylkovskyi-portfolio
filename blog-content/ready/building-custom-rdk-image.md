The integration of diverse technologies like Web Platform for Embedded (WPE), Reference Design Kit (RDK), Buildroot, and Raspberry Pi 4B opens up exciting possibilities in the field of embedded systems and IoT. In this guide, we'll explore how these technologies synergize to create powerful, efficient, and highly customizable embedded devices.

- **WPE and RDK**: WPE is a fully-featured browser engine specifically designed for embedded systems. It's lean, fast, and customizable, making it ideal for running web-based applications on devices with limited resources. RDK, on the other hand, is a software platform for set-top boxes, smart TVs, and other broadband devices, providing a common framework for powering customer-premises equipment. When combined, these technologies offer a robust foundation for developing advanced, web-enabled embedded devices.
- **Raspberry Pi 4B**: Raspberry Pi 4B, known for its versatility and performance, is a popular choice for embedded projects. Its ample processing power, memory, and connectivity options make it an excellent platform for hosting WPE and RDK, offering developers a flexible and powerful environment for their embedded applications.

- **Buildroot**: A key tool in this process is Buildroot, a simple, efficient, and flexible build system. Buildroot streamlines the process of creating a complete embedded Linux system. Unlike Yocto, another popular build system, Buildroot is known for its simplicity and speed, making it ideal for quickly setting up and prototyping embedded systems.

### Building with Buildroot

Buildroot is a powerful tool for building embedded Linux systems. It's simpler and faster compared to Yocto, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. You can learn more about Buildroot through [this comprehensive guide](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://bootlin.com/doc/training/buildroot/buildroot-slides.pdf).

### Setting Up a Virtual Machine

Our development environment will be based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, hosted on a MacOS X system using UTM, a versatile virtual machine manager for MacOS. The setup process is straightforward:

1. **Install UTM**: Download UTM from [here](https://mac.getutm.app/) and install it on your MacOS X.
2. **Download Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**: Acquire the UTM compatible image from the [UTM Gallery](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04) and follow the instructions to set up your virtual machine.

#### Minimum Requirements for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Virtual Machine

Ensure your virtual machine meets these minimum requirements for smooth operation:

- **RAM**: 12GB or more
- **CPU Cores**: At least 6, preferably on a powerful Mac M1
- **Storage**: 100GB minimum, 150GB recommended (considering the OS takes around 16GB)

#### Expanding the Ubuntu Partition

After allocating storage to your VM, follow these steps to expand the Ubuntu partition:

1. Identify the partition using `df -H`.
2. Locate your disk using `sudo parted -l`.
3. Check available space with `sudo vgdisplay`.
4. Extend the logical volume using `sudo lvextend -L +20G <partition-name>`.
5. Resize the filesystem: `sudo resize2fs <partition-name>`.

Confirm the expansion by rerunning `df -H`.

### Cross-Compiling with Buildroot

With the hardware and software prerequisites in place, we're ready to start cross-compiling. This involves installing dependencies, cloning the Buildroot repository, configuring the build, and finally generating the OS image.

#### Installing Software Dependencies

Follow the instructions on [RDK Central](https://rdktools.rdkcentral.com/tools__certification/raspberry_pi/index.html) to install essential packages:

```sh
# essential packages installation
# super user mode is required

# major essential packages
sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib g++-multilib build-essential chrpath socat bison curl cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 xterm
```

#### Cloning and Configuring Buildroot

Clone the Buildroot repository from the [WebPlatformForEmbedded organization](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/buildroot) and checkout the appropriate branch for our build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/buildroot.git
cd buildroot
git checkout R4_4
```

Configure Buildroot for the Raspberry Pi 4B by editing the `raspberrypi4_64_wpe_ml_defconfig` file in the `/configs` directory. Add necessary configurations, then use `make menuconfig` to access additional configuration options.

As part of configuring Buildroot, it's crucial to ensure that our build includes all necessary components. Through my experimentation, I found that the build process requires certain additional configurations to succeed. Let's modify the `raspberrypi4_64_wpe_ml_defconfig` file to incorporate these configurations:

```sh
sudo nano ./configs/raspberrypi4_64_wpe_ml_defconfig
```

**WPE ML (Media Layer):** This configuration focused on optimizing WebKit for Embedded (WPE) for media playback. It might include specific settings for better handling of multimedia content, optimizations for video and audio codecs, and possibly some machine learning enhancements for media processing.

Within this configuration file, add the following lines:

```sh
BR2_PACKAGE_WPEWEBKIT2_38=y
BR2_PACKAGE_WPEFRAMEWORK_MESSAGING=y
```

These lines are pivotal for the build process. The `BR2_PACKAGE_WPEWEBKIT2_38` directive instructs Buildroot to include the WPE Webkit source code, specifically from the GitHub branch tagged `2_38`. This version is selected for its stability and compatibility with our target system.

Similarly, `BR2_PACKAGE_WPEFRAMEWORK_MESSAGING` refers to a necessary package from RDK Thunder, which, if omitted, results in an incomplete build. Including this package ensures that all required components of the RDK framework are present, facilitating a successful build process.

By integrating these configurations, we address potential gaps in the default setup and pave the way for a smooth and efficient build experience. If you are curious what does each configuration represents, refer to the [apendinx for breakdown of each configuration option](#appendix---buildroot-configurations-breakdown).

### Fine-Tuning the Configuration with menuconfig

After incorporating the essential configurations, we need to delve deeper and adjust additional settings via the Buildroot configuration interface. This step is vital for tailoring the build to our specific requirements. Begin by executing the following command in the root folder of Buildroot:

```sh
make menuconfig
```

This command launches a user interface that allows for an interactive configuration experience. You'll be presented with a menu-driven interface as shown below:

![Configuration Interface](./building-custom-rdk-image/make-menuconfig.png)

In this interface, you'll navigate through various options and make selections that align with our project's requirements. The process is iterative, and it's crucial to carefully enable or disable specific configurations as per your needs. The following table, inspired by a [discussion in the WPEWebKit GitHub repository](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/WPEWebKit/issues/500#issuecomment-435590466), outlines the key configurations to adjust:

| Operation in menuconfig |                     Location                      |                                             Value |
| ----------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------: |
| ENABLE                  | Target packages -> Filesystem and flash utilities |                                        dosfstools |
| ENABLE                  | Target packages -> Filesystem and flash utilities |                                            mtools |
| ENABLE                  |                 Filesystem images                 |                          ext2/3/4 root filesystem |
| ENABLE                  |                 Filesystem images                 |                          ext2/3/4 root filesystem |
| SET VALUE               |                 Filesystem images                 | ext2/3/4 root filesystem -> ext2/3/4 variant ext4 |
| DISABLE                 |                 Filesystem images                 |   initial RAM filesystem linked into linux kernel |
| ENABLE                  |            Host utilities -> genimage             |   initial RAM filesystem linked into linux kernel |

Each configuration option serves a specific purpose:

- **dosfstools and mtools**: These utilities are essential for file system management, particularly for FAT file systems, which are commonly used in embedded systems.
- **ext2/3/4 root filesystem**: Enabling support for ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems ensures compatibility and flexibility in managing the root filesystem of the embedded Linux.
- **ext4 variant**: Setting the ext2/3/4 root filesystem to use the ext4 variant offers a balance of performance and reliability, making it a preferred choice for many embedded applications.
- **Initial RAM filesystem**: Disabling the initial RAM filesystem linked into the Linux kernel can help optimize boot time and system resources, especially in resource-constrained environments.

By meticulously adjusting these settings, you ensure that the Buildroot environment is optimally configured for building a robust and efficient WPE and RDK image for the Raspberry Pi 4B.

#### Cross-Compiling the Image

Start the cross-compiling process with `make`. This may take some time, as building a Buildroot image is resource-intensive.

### Troubleshooting and Patching During Build

The build process can occasionally encounter issues, such as missing dependencies, configuration errors, or problems in the source code. Efficiently addressing these challenges involves a systematic approach that includes iterative troubleshooting, applying patches, or making direct modifications in the build folder. Here’s how to navigate these challenges:

1. **Identify and Resolve the Issue**: First, pinpoint the problem and implement a solution.
2. **Clean the Previous Output**: Use `rm -rf output` or `make clean` to clear any previous, potentially corrupted build outputs.
3. **Rebuild the System**: Run `make` to start the build process again.

This process is cyclical; if a new issue arises, repeat these steps until the build succeeds.

#### Strategies for Fixing Issues

Different types of build problems require different strategies:

- **Missing Dependencies**: If an error indicates a missing file or library, the solution often involves installing the missing dependency. For example, the error message `fatal error: gmp.h: No such file or directory` suggests that the `libgmp-dev` package is missing and can be installed using `sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev`.

- **Changing Configuration**: Sometimes, the issue may stem from an incomplete or incorrect configuration. An example of this was our earlier modification to the `raspberrypi4_64_wpe_ml_defconfig`, where we added `BR2_PACKAGE_WPEWEBKIT2_38=y` and `BR2_PACKAGE_WPEFRAMEWORK_MESSAGING=y` to address specific build requirements.

- **Applying a Patch to the Source Code**: When a specific package fails during the build, applying a patch can be effective. This involves identifying the problematic package, applying the necessary patch, and then rebuilding. Patches can be created using `git` and are well-documented in the [Buildroot training materials](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://bootlin.com/doc/training/buildroot/buildroot-slides.pdf). For instance, a known issue with a Python package missing `_ctypes` can be resolved with a specific [patch](https://bugs.busybox.net/attachment.cgi?id=9006&action=edit) as detailed in [this bug report](https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=13661).

- **Direct Modifications in the Build Folder**: In some cases, directly editing the code in the `/output/build` folder may be the quickest solution. This approach, however, is temporary as any changes will be lost if the build folder is cleaned.

#### Resolving Specific Build Issues

During the build, I encountered and resolved several issues. For instance:

- **Patches for WPE/WPEWEBKIT**:

  1. Navigate to `/output/build/linux-custom/scripts/dtc/dtc-lexer.lex.c`.
  2. Modify the line `YYLTYPE yylloc` to `extern YYLTYPE yylloc`.

- **Patches for WPE/WPEFRAMEWORK-rdk-services**:
  1. Go to `/output/build/wpe/wpeframework-rdkservices*(version)/CMakeLists.txt`.
  2. Comment out the following lines:

```sh
...
#if(PLUGIN_MONITOR)
#    add_subdirectory(Monitor)
#endif()
...
# if(PLUGIN_TRACECONTROL)
#    add_subdirectory(PLUGIN_TRACECONTROL)
# endif()
...
```

- **Fix for WPE/WPEFRAMEWORK**:
  1. Add the `BR2_PACKAGE_WPEFRAMEWORK_MESSAGING=y` to configuration.

These modifications addressed specific issues I encountered, facilitating a successful build process.

### Applying Patches to Packages in Buildroot

This section is dedicated to elucidating the process of applying patches to a package within the Buildroot environment. The steps below outline this process using the example of patching the **WPE/WPEFRAMEWORK-rdk-services** package.

1. **Identify the Package**: First, pinpoint the package requiring a patch. For demonstration purposes, we're focusing on `packages/wpe/wpeframework-rdkservices`.

2. **Locate the Source Code**: The source code for the package is typically specified in the package's `.mk` file. In our case, the relevant repository is `ThunderNanoServicesRDK`, accessible at `https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/ThunderNanoServicesRDK`.

3. **Check Out the Correct Commit**: The specific commit to work from can also be found in the `.mk` file. For this example, it's `R4.4.1`.

4. **Modify the Code**: Proceed to make the necessary changes to the code. In this example, we are commenting out specific lines in the `CMakeLists.txt` file:

   ```sh
   ...
   #if(PLUGIN_MONITOR)
   #    add_subdirectory(Monitor)
   #endif()
   ...
   # if(PLUGIN_TRACECONTROL)
   #    add_subdirectory(PLUGIN_TRACECONTROL)
   # endif()
   ...
   ```

5. **Commit the Changes**: Use Git to commit your changes with the following command:

   ```sh
   git add . & git commit -m "Patching Trace Control and Monitor" -n
   ```

6. **Generate the Patch**: Next, create a patch file using the command `git format-patch R4.4.1`. This will produce a patch file resembling the following:

   ```patch

```

This is just a binary that exists in our raspberry pi image. You can find more binaries by navigating to the binaries folder.

1. Find the binaries location. This is usually indicated in the `$PATH` environment variable.

```sh
echo $PATH

... Output ...

/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
```

2. Navigate to the binaries location from path. By looking at the code snippet above, it is in `/usr/bin`

3. Observe the binaries

![Alt text](./building-custom-rdk-image/binaries_in_linux.png)

### Enabling GStreamer Logs

You can tail the logs by enabling WPEFramework-1.0.0. However, it will not show all the logs. We can expand those. For instance to increase verbosity of gStreamer logs run the following:

```sh
export GST_DEBUG=3
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we have successfully navigated the complexities of building a WPE and RDK image for the Raspberry Pi 4B using Buildroot. From setting up a virtual machine to configuring and cross-compiling with Buildroot, each step was meticulously detailed to ensure a smooth process. The culmination of our efforts is the operational RDK environment on the Raspberry Pi, demonstrated through the use of ThunderUI and the Metrologic UI.
