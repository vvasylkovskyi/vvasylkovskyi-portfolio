# Embedded CEA608 Subtitles

CEA-608 captions are usually embedded into a video signal or stream, and are not typically something that a content creator would add in post-production as a separate file, like you would with SRT or WebVTT files. Instead, CEA-608 captions are often generated and encoded in real-time during the production or distribution of broadcast television content.

However, if you're working with video files and want to include CEA-608 captions, you'd generally need specialized software or hardware encoders that can insert the caption data into the video file's metadata. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Creating Captions**: You need to create the caption data. For CEA-608, this is usually done with captioning software that supports this standard. The captions are created as a separate file with timing and formatting information.

2. **Encoding Captions**: Once you have the caption data, you use a video encoder to embed the captions into the video file. For digital files like MP4, you'll typically embed the captions in a format known as 'CEA-608 in SEI' within the H.264 stream.

3. **Preparing the Video**: The video file, now with embedded CEA-608 captions, is prepared for distribution. If you're going to stream it, you might use a streaming server that supports HLS or another streaming protocol that can handle embedded captions.

4. **Playback**: Finally, on the playback side, you need a video player that can decode the CEA-608 captions from the video stream and display them. Modern web browsers and media players are often capable of this.

Here is an example of how you might use FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia framework, to embed CEA-608 captions into a video file:

```bash
ffmpeg -i Big_Buck_Bunny.mp4 -i captions.scc -c:v copy -c:a copy -scodec mov_text -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng Big_Buck_Bunny_with_Captions.mp4
```

In this command:

- `-i Big_Buck_Bunny.mp4`: This specifies the input video file.
- `-i captions.scc`: This specifies the input caption file in the SCC format, which is one of the common formats used for CEA-608 captions.
- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`: These options tell FFmpeg to copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding them.
- `-scodec mov_text`: This option specifies the subtitle codec. For embedding CEA-608, this might be different and depend on the format FFmpeg expects.
- `-metadata:s:s:0 language=eng`: This sets the language metadata for the subtitle stream to English.
- `Big_Buck_Bunny_with_Captions.mp4`: This is the output file with the embedded captions.

Please note that CEA-608 caption embedding is quite specific and may require trial and error to get right, especially in terms of player compatibility and the specifics of the encoding process. It's also worth noting that `.scc` is just one of the formats used for CEA-608 data. There are others, like `.cap`, that might be used in different production contexts.

Once you have a video file with embedded CEA-608 captions, you should be able to play it in a video player that supports embedded captions, and the captions will be displayed based on the viewer's settings.

In web development, handling embedded captions often means relying on the browser's built-in capabilities to handle them, or using a player library that has support for embedded captions. You would not typically handle the CEA-608 captions manually in the code; the player would detect and render them automatically based on the user's preferences.

## Building a .scc file

A .scc (Scenarist Closed Caption) file is one of the standard file formats used to store CEA-608 caption data. It includes timecodes and caption commands in a hexadecimal format.

Here's an example of a very simple .scc file that includes a few captions:

```scc

00:00:00:00	9420 942c 942f 9420 9452 616e 6420 736f 6d65 2074 6578 742e 9470 616e 6420 6120 7365 636f 6e64 206c 696e 652e
00:00:05:00	942c 942f 9420 94f2 4865 7265 2773 2073 6f6d 6520 6d6f 7265 2074 6578 7420 6f6e 2074 6865 2073 6372 6565 6e2e
00:00:10:00	942c 942f 9420 9476 5468 6972 6420 6c69 6e65 206f 6620 7465 7874 2068 6572 652e
00:00:15:00	942c
```

```scc
Scenarist_SCC V1.0

00:00:00;00	9420 94ae 97a2 91ae 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 74 68 65 20 66 69 72 73 74 20 63 61 70 74 69 6f 6e 2e 94f4 97a2 91ae 54 68 65 20 73 75 62 74 69 74 6c 65 20 77 69 6c 6c 20 61 70 70 65 61 72 20 73 6f 6f 6e 2e 942c 942f
00:00:05;00	9420 94ae 97a2 91ae 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 74 68 65 20 73 65 63 6f 6e 64 20 63 61 70 74 69 6f 6e 2e 942c 942f

```

This .scc file defines four different time-coded events:

1. At `00:00:00:00` (HH:MM:SS:FF), the captions "And some text. And a second line." will appear.
2. At `00:00:05:00`, the caption changes to "Here's some more text on the screen."
3. At `00:00:10:00`, it changes again to "Third line of text here."
4. At `00:00:15:00`, the captions are cleared from the screen.

The hexadecimal codes represent various commands:

- `9420`: Resume Caption Loading (RCL), which starts the caption.
- `942c`: Erase Displayed Memory (EDM), which clears the displayed caption.
- `942f`: End of Caption (EOC), which indicates the end of a caption and swaps the off-screen buffer to be displayed.
- `9452`, `94f2`, `9476`: These are row codes that set the vertical positioning of the captions.
- The following hex pairs (`61`, `6e`, `64`, `20`, etc.) represent the characters to be displayed.

Remember, this is just an example, and depending on the software you use to create the .scc file, you might see slightly different formatting or commands. Also, note that `00:00:00:00` is the time code format (hours:minutes:seconds:frames), and you should replace these with the correct time codes for your video content. The frame rate for the .scc should match the frame rate of the video; otherwise, the captions won't be synchronized correctly.

Lastly, to properly encode this .scc file with your video using FFmpeg, ensure that FFmpeg has been compiled with libzvbi support, as this is required for encoding CEA-608 captions. If everything is set up correctly, the example FFmpeg command provided in the previous message can be used to embed these captions into the video.
